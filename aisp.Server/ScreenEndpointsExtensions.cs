/// distinction between them, passes the client's parameters along as the query string, and adds
/// the map and channel the client is on (map=, ch=), which the URL itself does not carry:
///   /ai-sp/room-tv?movieid=...            a TV given a movie id (動画指定)
///   /ai-sp/channel-screen?tvid=..&chid=.. a TV or town screen on a channel
///   /ai-sp/live-watch?liveid=...          the Nico Live billboard
///   /ai-sp/screen?url=...                 anything else the client asked aisp.jp for
///   /ai-sp/screen-source?route=..&map=..  JSON {src} the page polls for changes
/// All of them serve the same page: it shows which route and parameters it got, implements the
/// script contract the client drives (external_nico_0.ext_*), and publishes volume, mute and the
/// source to play in its title for the hook. The source is decided here from ScreenAssignments.
